          I joined our schoolâ€™s robotics club as a sophomore, a year later than most of my peers, but it quickly became my primary commitment 
	  to make up for lost time. My 3 years of experience in VEX Robotics have armed me a toolbox of skills. In VEX, I took on the role of 
	  our main chassis assembler and drive coach. Additionally, I gained substantial experience in PID control loops, odometry, and MATLAB, 
	  while also leveraging my knowledge in mechanical design and engineering notebooks. This expertise led our team to claim numerous titles
	  including World Championship Divisional 1st place (2x), 2019 1st place World Driver Skills Ranking, 
	  VEX Robotics 2020 National Signature Event Tournament Champion, Regional Tournament Champions (8x).

          The objectives of the 2020 season, Tower Takeover, was to capture cubes and stack them in specified areas as well as score the cubes in
          towers located around the field. We were able to create a robot that completed all of these tasks efficiently, scoring more
          points much faster than most if not all of the other teams. We secured 1st place in our division during the 2020 World Championships,
	  ended as divisional finalists, and won the national signature event (the second largest competition in the world).

	  In the 2019 season, Turning Point, the game entailed pick up and launch balls at acrylic flags to toggle them to a given color, to pick up,
          flip, and place caps onto raised poles, and climb a platform at the end of the match. Our choices regarding mechanical design and autonomous
	  programming allowed our team to remain undefeated and secure 1st place in our division during the 2019 World Championships.

          Change Up was the 2020-2021 VEX Robotics season, and my first year on the Purdue SIGBots team. Although many competitions were
          canceled because of Covid, we were still able to compete in two tournaments this season. Our first tournament was hosted by
          Auburn University which we ended up winning. Our second competition was in place of the World Championship and was hosted at
          VEX headquarters in Greenville Texas. We ended up as finalists, losing in the final match but also won Skills Champion and the
          Think Award.

          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up balls from the ground and score them in the nine goals located around the
          field as well as descore the opposing team's color from these goals. Bonus points are awarded to teams who can create rows, columns,
          or diagonals with their color. This game was much simpler than most games so the real challenge was scoring as efficiently as
          possible. One way this differed from my previous experience is that with the VEXU competition, teams are allowed to manufacture
          custom parts. This allowed us to use laser-cut metals and 3D-printed parts on our robots.

          Turning Point was the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics season. My team, 7701T Tesseract, qualified for both the Indiana State Championship
          and the VEX World Championship. We placed 18th in the world for individual skills out of around 10,000 international teams.
          At the 2019 World Championship, we made it to the elimination matches where we finished as division semi-finalists. We earned
          a total of 3 awards this year: Excellence Award, Judges Award, and the Amaze Award.

          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up and shoot balls at plastic flags to toggle them to your color, to pick up,
          flip, and place caps onto raised poles, and climb a platform at the end of the match. We used the engineering process to create
          the robot to effectively and efficiently complete all of these tasks.
