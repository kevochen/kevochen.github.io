                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p class="lead">A junior @ Northwestern University with a knack for aerospace and sustainable engineering. Beyond school, I am involved with wildfire prevention, designing medical devices, and music production. My background is in mechanical design and machining techniques, stemming from my experience from VEX Robotics, Materials Research, and NASA Langley.</p>

                <h3>My Ambitions</h3>

                <p>The stars rise and set every night, constantly reminding the dreamer in all of us that there is something out there to discover. They served as shepherds for mankind, guiding explorers who yearned to understand what lies beyond since the invention of sails. Thus, humanity reached into the cosmos years ago to satiate our drive for discovery. Yet, ever since then, space has slowly seemed to drift further away, clouded by indecision and bureaucracy.</p>

                <p>
                In recent years, new pioneers have reignited a desire to explore the stars. Infected by this vision, I want nothing more but to be part of the next generation of explorers. Moreover, I am confident that my previous experience will allow me to hit the ground running, but I also will embrace the adaptability and unwavering perseverance at the core of engineering. After all, what better way to improve life down on Earth than by making our mark in the heavens.

                            <p>In the summer of 2023, I worked at Sierra Space as a stress analyst and manufacturing engineer. In those 12 weeks, I assessed Dreamchaser subsystems for structural health using FEMAP NASTRAN as a part of the final test campaign before its inaugural launch in 2024. I also devised and presented revised thermal margins for the external cargo mounting interface in conjunction with NASA ISS mating team as Sierra’s responsible engineer. In manufacturing, I conducted purging operations and X-ray inspection for the peroxide and kerosene tanks before orbital welding and final vehicle integration.

Specifically, I conducted flexural testing of Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/ACS3" target="_blank">ACS3</a>) composite booms, 
			       and assisted in cube-sat assembly and deployment tests. This mission is set to launch in December aboard a Rocket Lab Electron vehicle. I also designed crushable hybrid composite-polymer structures to improve passenger safety aboard new <a href="https://nari.arc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/Workshop4_4_NASA.pdf" target="_blank">experimental VTOL</a> aircraft. 
			       A <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-crash-tests-evtol-concept/" target="_blank">large scale gantry crash test</a> was completed in the fall of 2022, where these absorbers and test article successful completed a trial in the validation process.

My objective during this period was to design and develop a biaxial test frame to perform fracture analysis on various composites. This data would be used to determine material properties to better inform manufacturers as composites become increasingly relevant within the aerospace and automotive industries. I also was tasked with machining specimens using conventional and CNC mill, lathe, diamond-edged bandsaw, and waterjet. These opportunities allowed me to hone my skills in SOLIDWORKS, stress analysis through Abaqus, and also gain certification for operating shop machinery. Further publications are pending as well.</p>

			       have armed me a toolbox of skills. On my team, I took on the role of our main chassis assembler and drive coach. Additionally, I gained substantial experience in PID control loops, odometry, inertial sensors, and pneumatics, while also leveraging my knowledge in mechanical design and and building techniques.

These batteries of evaluation function as the final checkoffs before final vehicle intergration before launch. As a fluids manufacturing engineer, I also worked closely with the integration of the propulsion feed system, owning several pieces of documentation regarding the installation of the forward and aft thruster isolation assemblies. </p>

                            <p>My most recent personal project has been the design and drafting of a RC Plane inspired by the Anvil Arrow from the Star Citizen IP. Employing NX and Inventor Sheet Metal, I created a foamboard body and drawing to enable flow modeling of the plane in Ansys Fluent CFD to obtain a lift:drag ratio of 13.1:1, sufficient for protoflight. We are also writing a fully autonomous flight algorithm with waypoint and GPS tracking capability. Paired with LQR control theory for flight stability and odometry for position referencing between GPS updates, the plane can accurately fly pre-programmed routes.</p>

	  and their potential role in pain-related behavior. In the following summers, I remained in my previous lab where I had established a strong foundation 
	  operating confocal microscopes and other wet lab machinery. I concluded my research with a <a href="poster.pdf" target="_blank">poster presentation</a>

		<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
		</div>

                <p>Following a trip to the Huangshan, a nearly 2 kilometer tall mountain range in China, I managed to conquer the greatest phobia I had, the fear of heights. Although the methods were ones of brute force (I bawled the entire way up), it dawned on me that no challenge I would encounter in the future would be as hard as ascending those steep cliffs. This event is what led me to pursue rock climbing, an activity that I wholeheartedly avoided in the past, but now would demonstrate if I had truly overcome my fear. I had not — not entirely. That was 6 years ago, and I am climbing to this day.

		<h3>Music production</h3>
		</div>

                <p>I fell in love with music twice. Once while I was learning the Alto Saxophone in middle school, and once this past year after listening to Kanye West's 5th studio album, "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy." Upon my first listen, I had yet to comphrehend the scope of its vivid soundscape accompanied by many profoundly personal lyrics, but I knew I had never heard anything like it before. I then found myself diving head first into music and learning how it is mixed and produced. Linked below are some original pieces and covers I have creating using Cakewalk by BandLab.

		<h3>Art</h3>
		</div>

                <p>Drawing and painting have always been a pastime for me. It acts like a medium between reality and my perception of the world. I've also
	   learned to use art to visualize concepts difficult to communicate in text. I find this method extremely effective when demonstrating
	   mechanical systems in engineering.

		<h3>Butters</h3>

                <p>After I left for college, my parents decided that they had to fill the void in the home with something. So we adopted a dog — her name is Butters. We soon learned that fostering a puppy is a full time job, for 3 people. In the two years we have had her, I've learned countless lessons, but now I know to prepare for more.
