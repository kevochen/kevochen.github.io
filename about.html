        <h1>Hi, I'm Kevin</h1>
        <p>I'm a student at Purdue University studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. I love road trips and traveling
          to national parks, hiking, cycling, skating, and hanging out with my dog Juneau. I've been on competition robotics teams
          for almost six years competing in the VEX Robotics, VEXU, and VEXAI Competitions. I love to make things ranging from
          RC planes and mechanical keyboards to programming software and games. I hope you get to learn more about me from this website.

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <div class="meat">
        <h2>VEX Robotics</h2>
        <h3>Aug 2016 - Present</h3>
        <p>I have competed in the VEX Robotics Competition for 5 total years now and starting a 6th. Responsibilities include designing the
          robot through CAD and sketches, building the robot and its mechanisms, programming the robot for both autonomous movements and
          operator-controlled movements, documentation of all these processes, and competing against other teams regionally, nationally,
          and globally.
        </p>
        <p>I have competed on team 7701Y for the 2016-2017, team 7701T for 3 seasons from 2017 to 2020, and now currently on team BLRS since
          2020 as a part of Purdue ACM SIGBots. These seasons include the games Starstruck, In the Zone, Turning Point, Tower Takeover,
          Change Up, and this year's game Tipping Point. I was the team captain of team 7701T all 3 years pushing my team to do their best.
          My teams and I have received a total of 19 awards, 11 of which are from the 2019-2020 season Tower Takeover.
        </p>
        <p>More information on the past 3 seasons can be found <a href="projects.html">here.</a></p>
        <h2>The UPS Store</h2>
        <h3>Aug 2019 - Present (Part-Time)</h3>
        <p>I work with customers to ship and pack items to UPS standards. This involves greeting the customers, typing their information
          into the computer to generate a label, correctly pack the item if necessary based on the fragility of the item(s), and organize
          the packages for the driver to pick them up. Another major part of working is to complete print orders for customers. This includes
          designing a document or image if needed and operating the various printers to the customers' needs. Other tasks include laminating,
          binding, typing, and designing documents, flyers, and business cards.
        </p>
        <h2>Purdue Undergraduate Reserach Expo</h2>
        <h3>Jan 2021 - May 2021</h3>
        <p>I worked with a team to develop a waypoint-based approach towards autonomous driving. We did this by creating a convolutional
          neural network and simulations in Unity. We trained the NN in Unity by creating various driving simulations using various methods
          such as following a line of manually plotted points using PID. We then implemented the NN into Unity and were able to drive a car
          autonomously around a simulated Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

        <h2>Building & Flying RC Planes</h2>
        <p>I've built 3 radio controlled planes using plans from <a href="https://store.flitetest.com/" target="_blank">FliteTest</a>. Although they
          are fun to fly, I seem to enjoy my time better building the planes from scratch starting with foamboard, hot glue, and some
          sketches. See more about it <a href="projects.html#rcp">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Skateboarding, Cycling, Spikeball</h2>
        <p>I'm always skating to classes and skating around campus on my cruiser board or longboard. I don't know many tricks yet but I'm
          getting there. I also love to cycle, both mountain biking and road biking. Nothing beats zooming through the forest on your bike.
          I'm also a huge fan of spikeball and play it with friends and family often.
