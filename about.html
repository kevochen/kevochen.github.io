        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>A sophomore @ Northwestern University with a knack for aerospace and sustainable engineering. 
	  Beyond school, I am involved with materials science research, designing medical devices, and music production. 
	  My background is in mechanical design and machining techniques, stemming from my experience competing in VEX Robotics under team 7701X.

      <h1>Ambitions</h1>
      <div class="meat">
        <p>The stars rise and set every night, constantly reminding the dreamer in all of us that there is something out there to discover. 
	   They served as shepherds for mankind, guiding explorers who yearned to understand what lies beyond since the invention of sails. 
	   Thus, humanity reached into the cosmos years ago to satiate our drive for discovery. Yet, ever since then, space has slowly 
	   seemed to drift further away, clouded by indecision and bureaucracy. In recent years, new pioneers have reignited a desire to 
	   explore the stars. Infected by this vision, I want nothing more but to be part of the next generation of explorers. Moreover, I am 
	   confident that my previous experience will allow me to hit the ground running, but I also will embrace the adaptability and 
	   unwavering perseverance at the core of engineering. After all, what better way to improve life down on Earth than by making our mark in the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>I documented this intersection between spaceflight and material science in a <a href="Rocketry_Report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> as an undergraduate researcher.

        <h2>Rock climbing</h2>
        <p>Following a trip to the Huangshan, a nearly 2 kilometer tall mountain range in China, I managed to conquer the greatest phobia I had, the fear of heights.
	   Although the methods were ones of brute force (I bawled the entire way up), it dawned on me that no challenge I would encounter in the future would be as hard
	   as ascending those steep cliffs. This event is what led me to pursue rock climbing, an activity that I wholeheartedly avoided in the past, but now would demonstrate
	   if I had truly overcome my fear. I had not â€” not entirely. That was 6 years ago, and I am climbing to this day.

        <h2>Music production</h2>
        <p>I fell in love with music twice. Once while I was learning the Alto Saxophone in middle school, and once this past year after listening to Kanye West's
	   5th Studio album, "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy." Upon my first listen, I had yet to comphrehend the scope of its vivid soundscape accompanied by
	   many profoundly personal lyrics, but I knew I had never heard anything like it before. I then found myself diving head first into music and learning how
	   it is mixed and produced. Linked below are some original pieces and covers I have creating using Cakewalk by BandLab.

        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team to develop a waypoint-based approach towards autonomous driving. We did this by creating a convolutional
          neural network and simulations in Unity. We trained the NN in Unity by creating various driving simulations using various methods
          such as following a line of manually plotted points using PID. We then implemented the NN into Unity and were able to drive a car
          autonomously around a simulated Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
