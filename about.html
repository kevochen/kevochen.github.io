        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>A sophomore @ Northwestern University with a knack for aerospace and sustainable engineering. 
	  Beyond school, I am involved with materials science research, designing medical devices, and music production. 
	  My background is in mechanical design and machining techniques, stemming from my experience competing in VEX Robotics under team 7701X.

      <h1>My Ambitions</h1>
      <div class="meat">
        <p>The stars rise and set every night, constantly reminding the dreamer in all of us that there is something out there to discover. 
	   They served as shepherds for mankind, guiding explorers who yearned to understand what lies beyond since the invention of sails. 
	   Thus, humanity reached into the cosmos years ago to satiate our drive for discovery. Yet, ever since then, space has slowly 
	   seemed to drift further away, clouded by indecision and bureaucracy. In recent years, new pioneers have reignited a desire to 
	   explore the stars. Infected by this vision, I want nothing more but to be part of the next generation of explorers. Moreover, I am 
	   confident that my previous experience will allow me to hit the ground running, but I also will embrace the adaptability and 
	   unwavering perseverance at the core of engineering. After all, what better way to improve life down on Earth than by making our mark in the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>I documented this intersection between spaceflight and material science in a <a href="Rocketry_Report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> as an undergraduate researcher.

      <h1>My other side</h1>

        <h2>Rock climbing</h2>
        <p>I have competed in the VEX Robotics Competition for 5 total years now and starting a 6th. Responsibilities include designing the
          robot through CAD and sketches, building the robot and its mechanisms, programming the robot for both autonomous movements and
          operator-controlled movements, documentation of all these processes, and competing against other teams regionally, nationally,
          and globally.
        </p>
        <p>I have competed on team 7701Y for the 2016-2017, team 7701T for 3 seasons from 2017 to 2020, and now currently on team BLRS since
          2020 as a part of Purdue ACM SIGBots. These seasons include the games Starstruck, In the Zone, Turning Point, Tower Takeover,
          Change Up, and this year's game Tipping Point. I was the team captain of team 7701T all 3 years pushing my team to do their best.
          My teams and I have received a total of 19 awards, 11 of which are from the 2019-2020 season Tower Takeover.
        </p>
        <p>More information on the past 3 seasons can be found <a href="projects.html">here.</a></p>
        <h2>Music production</h2>
        <p>I work with customers to ship and pack items to UPS standards. This involves greeting the customers, typing their information
          into the computer to generate a label, correctly pack the item if necessary based on the fragility of the item(s), and organize
          the packages for the driver to pick them up. Another major part of working is to complete print orders for customers. This includes
          designing a document or image if needed and operating the various printers to the customers' needs. Other tasks include laminating,
          binding, typing, and designing documents, flyers, and business cards.
        </p>
        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team to develop a waypoint-based approach towards autonomous driving. We did this by creating a convolutional
          neural network and simulations in Unity. We trained the NN in Unity by creating various driving simulations using various methods
          such as following a line of manually plotted points using PID. We then implemented the NN into Unity and were able to drive a car
          autonomously around a simulated Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
